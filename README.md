# gradleproject

## This is a simple gradle progect wich contains one test created by using TestNG and Selenium

### I recomend to use [IntelliJ IDEA IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for this project

Create a new Gradle project then grab the test1.java from this repository
and insert it in into a src/test/java/ folder

All dependencies you can find in the build.gradle file of this repo
